##### GENERAL CONFIG ######
###########################

# String. Log level to use throughout the application. Must be lower-case.
# Options: ["trace","debug","info","warn","error","fatal"]
# Default: "info"
log-level: "info"

# Bool. Log database queries when log-level is set to debug or trace.
# This setting produces verbose logs, so it's better to only enable it
# when you're trying to track an issue down.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
log-db-queries: false

# String. Application name to use internally.
# Examples: ["My Application","gotosocial"]
# Default: "gotosocial"
application-name: "gotosocial"

# String. Hostname that this server will be reachable at. Defaults to localhost for local testing,
# but you should *definitely* change this when running for real, or your server won't work at all.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["gts.example.org","some.server.com"]
# Default: "localhost"
host: "localhost"

# String. Domain to use when federating profiles. This is useful when you want your server to be at
# eg., "gts.example.org", but you want the domain on accounts to be "example.org" because it looks better
# or is just shorter/easier to remember.
# To make this setting work properly, you need to redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/webfinger"
# to "gts.example.org/.well-known/webfinger" so that GtS can handle them properly.
# You should also redirect requests at "example.org/.well-known/nodeinfo" in the same way.
# An empty string (ie., not set) means that the same value as 'host' will be used.
# DO NOT change this after your server has already run once, or you will break things!
# Examples: ["example.org","server.com"]
# Default: ""
account-domain: ""

# String. Protocol to use for the server. Only change to http for local testing!
# This should be the protocol part of the URI that your server is actually reachable on. So even if you're
# running GoToSocial behind a reverse proxy that handles SSL certificates for you, instead of using built-in
# letsencrypt, it should still be https.
# Options: ["http","https"]
# Default: "https"
protocol: "https"

# String. Address to bind the GoToSocial server to.
# This can be an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address (surrounded in square brackets), or a hostname.
# Default value will bind to all interfaces.
# You probably won't need to change this unless you're setting GoToSocial up in some fancy way or
# you have specific networking requirements.
# Examples: ["0.0.0.0", "172.128.0.16", "localhost", "[::]", "[2001:db8::fed1]"]
# Default: "0.0.0.0"
bind-address: "0.0.0.0"

# Int. Listen port for the GoToSocial webserver + API. If you're running behind a reverse proxy and/or in a docker,
# container, just set this to whatever you like (or leave the default), and make sure it's forwarded properly.
# If you are running with built-in letsencrypt enabled, and running GoToSocial directly on a host machine, you will
# probably want to set this to 443 (standard https port), unless you have other services already using that port.
# This *MUST NOT* be the same as the letsencrypt port specified below, unless letsencrypt is turned off.
# Examples: [443, 6666, 8080]
# Default: 8080
port: 8080

# Array of string. CIDRs or IP addresses of proxies that should be trusted when determining real client IP from behind a reverse proxy.
# If you're running inside a Docker container behind Traefik or Nginx, for example, add the subnet of your docker network,
# or the gateway of the docker network, and/or the address of the reverse proxy (if it's not running on the host network).
# Example: ["127.0.0.1/32", "172.20.0.1"]
# Default: ["127.0.0.1/32"] (localhost)
trusted-proxies:
  - "127.0.0.1/32"

##### DATABASE CONFIG ######
############################

# Config pertaining to the Gotosocial database connection

# String. Database type.
# Options: ["postgres","sqlite"]
# Default: "postgres"
db-type: "postgres"

# String. Database address or parameters.
#
# For Postgres, this should be the address or socket at which the database can be reached.
#
# For Sqlite, this should be the path to your sqlite database file. Eg., /opt/gotosocial/sqlite.db.
# If the file doesn't exist at the specified path, it will be created.
# If just a filename is provided (no directory) then the database will be created in the same directory
# as the GoToSocial binary.
# If address is set to :memory: then an in-memory database will be used (no file).
# WARNING: :memory: should NOT BE USED except for testing purposes.
#
# Examples: ["localhost","my.db.host","127.0.0.1","192.111.39.110",":memory:", "sqlite.db"]

# If "require" then TLS will be required to make a connection, and a valid certificate must be presented.
# Options: ["disable", "enable", "require"]
# Default: "disable"
db-tls-mode: "disable"

# String. Path to a CA certificate on the host machine for db certificate validation.
# If this is left empty, just the host certificates will be used.
# If filled in, the certificate will be loaded and added to host certificates.
# Examples: ["/path/to/some/cert.crt"]
# Default: ""
db-tls-ca-cert: ""

###########################
##### INSTANCE CONFIG #####
###########################

# Config pertaining to instance federation settings, pages to hide/expose, etc.

# Bool. Allow unauthenticated users to make queries to /api/v1/instance/peers?filter=open in order
# to see a list of instances that this instance 'peers' with. Even if set to 'false', then authenticated
# users (members of the instance) will still be able to query the endpoint.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
instance-expose-peers: false

# Bool. Allow unauthenticated users to make queries to /api/v1/instance/peers?filter=suspended in order
# to see a list of instances that this instance blocks/suspends. This will also allow unauthenticated
# users to see the list through the web UI. Even if set to 'false', then authenticated users (members
# of the instance) will still be able to query the endpoint.
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
instance-expose-suspended: false

# Bool. This flag tweaks whether GoToSocial will deliver ActivityPub messages
# to the shared inbox of a recipient, if one is available, instead of delivering
# each message to each actor who should receive a message individually.
#
# Shared inbox delivery can significantly reduce network load when delivering
# to multiple recipients share an inbox (eg., on large Mastodon instances).
#
# See: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#shared-inbox-delivery
#
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
instance-deliver-to-shared-inboxes: true

###########################
##### ACCOUNTS CONFIG #####
###########################

# Config pertaining to creation and maintenance of accounts on the server, as well as defaults for new accounts.

# Bool. Do we want people to be able to just submit sign up requests, or do we want invite only?
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
accounts-registration-open: true

# Bool. Do sign up requests require approval from an admin/moderator before an account can sign in/use the server?
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
accounts-approval-required: true

# Bool. Are sign up requests required to submit a reason for the request (eg., an explanation of why they want to join the instance)?
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: true
accounts-reason-required: true

# Bool. Allow accounts on this instance to set custom CSS for their profile pages and statuses.
# Enabling this setting will allow accounts to upload custom CSS via the /user settings page,
# which will then be rendered on the web view of the account's profile and statuses.
#
# For instances with public sign ups, it is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** to leave this setting on 'false',
# since setting it to true allows malicious accounts to make their profile pages misleading, unusable
# or even dangerous to visitors. In other words, you should only enable this setting if you trust
# the users on your instance not to produce harmful CSS.
#
# Regardless of what this value is set to, any uploaded CSS will not be federated to other instances,
# it will only be shown on profiles and statuses on *this* instance.
#
# Options: [true, false]
# Default: false
accounts-allow-custom-css: false

########################
##### MEDIA CONFIG #####

# Int. Number of days to cache media from remote instances before they are removed from the cache.
# A job will run every day at midnight to clean up any remote media older than the given amount of days.
#
# When remote media is removed from the cache, it is deleted from storage but the database entries for the media
# are kept so that it can be fetched again if requested by a user.
#
# If this is set to 0, then media from remote instances will be cached indefinitely.
# Examples: [30, 60, 7, 0]
# Default: 30
media-remote-cache-days: 30

# Int. Max size in bytes of emojis uploaded to this instance via the admin API.
# The default is the same as the Mastodon size limit for emojis (50kb), which allows

# Default: 51200
media-emoji-local-max-size: 51200

# Int. Max size in bytes of emojis to download from other instances.
# By default this is 100kb, or twice the size of the default for media-emoji-local-max-size.
# This strikes a good balance between decent interoperability with instances that have
# higher emoji size limits, and not taking up too much space in storage.
# Examples: [51200, 102400]
# Default: 51200
media-emoji-remote-max-size: 102400

# Examples: [80, 8000, 1312]
# Default: 80
letsencrypt-port: 80

# String. Directory in which to store LetsEncrypt certificates.
# It is a good move to make this a sub-path within your storage directory, as it makes

# These settings are useful when one wants to daemonize GoToSocial and send logs
# to a specific place, either a local location or a syslog server. Most users will
# not need to touch these settings.

# Bool. Enable the syslog logging hook. Logs will be mirrored to the configured destination.
# Options: [true, false]

##### ADVANCED SETTINGS #####
#############################

# Advanced settings pertaining to http timeouts, security, cookies, and more.
#
# ONLY ADJUST THESE SETTINGS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
#
# Most users will not need to (and should not) touch these settings, since
# they are set to sensible defaults, and may break if they are changed.
#
# Nevertheless, they are provided for the sake of allowing server admins to
# tweak their instance for performance or security reasons.

# String. Value of the SameSite attribute of cookies set by GoToSocial.
# Defaults to 'lax' to ensure that the OIDC flow does not break, which is
# fine in most cases. If you want to harden your instance against CSRF attacks
# and don't mind if some login-related things might break, you can set this
# to 'strict' instead.
#
# For an overview of what this does, see:
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite
#
# Options: ["lax", "strict"]
# Default: "lax"
advanced-cookies-samesite: "lax"
